# Advent of Code 2022

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2022 solutions implemented using Deno.

## Install Deno

To get started, make sure you have Deno installed. You can follow the instructions provided on the [official Deno website](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) to install it.

## Running the Code

The solutions for each day are organized into separate folders. Each day's folder contains the code files and input files associated with that particular day.

For example, Day 1's solutions can be found in the `./src/day1` folder, which includes the following files:

- `input.txt`
- `part1.ts`
- `part2.ts`.

To execute a specific part of a given day's challenge, you can use the following command:

```sh
 deno task run day1 part1
```

## Output

Upon running a specific day's part, the corresponding output will be displayed, providing the result of the computation.

Example Output:

```sh
